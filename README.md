# Udacity_Sentiment_Analysis

This was the final project as part of the Udacity Deep Learning course which used Amazon SageMaker. 

A sentiment analysis model was created to identify the sentiment of movie reviews as negative or positive. Finally a web app was also created so users can input a test review and a Negative or Positive result is output.
